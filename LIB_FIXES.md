# JavaScript Library Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to the JavaScript files in the `/public/lib` folder to ensure they work properly in the Next.js project.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies
- **Problem**: Scripts referenced external libraries (Swiper, Vivus, TweenMax, ScrollMagic) that weren't loaded
- **Solution**: Added CDN links for missing dependencies in `layout.js`
- **Files affected**: `home.js`, `news.js`, `projects.js`, `webinars.js`, `scrolling-effects.js`, `menu.js`, `distortion.js`

### 2. Global Variables Not Defined
- **Problem**: Scripts referenced `evtIn`, `evtOut`, `evtClick` variables that weren't defined
- **Solution**: Added global variable definitions in `utils.js` and `utls.js`
- **Files affected**: All files that use event handling

### 3. Missing DOM Elements
- **Problem**: Scripts tried to access DOM elements that might not exist
- **Solution**: Added null checks and graceful error handling
- **Files affected**: `main-dist.js`, `cursor.js`, `menu.js`, `home.js`, `news.js`, `projects.js`, `webinars.js`, `sticky.js`

### 4. Script Loading Order
- **Problem**: Scripts were loaded in random order, causing dependency issues
- **Solution**: Reorganized script loading order in `layout.js`:
  1. External dependencies (CDN)
  2. Local utility libraries
  3. Local animation libraries
  4. Local components
  5. Page-specific scripts

### 5. Missing utils.js File
- **Problem**: `layout.js` referenced `utils.js` but the file was named `utls.js`
- **Solution**: Created `utils.js` with the same functionality as `utls.js`

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `src/app/layout.js` - Fixed script loading order and added missing dependencies
- `public/lib/utils.js` - Created new file with utility functions
- `public/lib/utls.js` - Enhanced with global variables and initialization

### Component Files
- `public/lib/main-dist.js` - Added DOM ready checks and null element handling
- `public/lib/cursor.js` - Added element existence checks and error handling
- `public/lib/menu.js` - Added dependency checks and null element handling
- `public/lib/sticky.js` - Added DOM ready wrapper and error handling

### Slider Files
- `public/lib/home.js` - Added Swiper dependency check and element validation
- `public/lib/news.js` - Added Swiper dependency check and element validation
- `public/lib/projects.js` - Added Swiper dependency check and element validation
- `public/lib/webinars.js` - Added Swiper dependency check and element validation

### Animation Files
- `public/lib/scrolling-effects.js` - Added ScrollMagic/TweenMax dependency checks
- `public/lib/distortion.js` - Added TweenMax dependency check and global export

## Dependencies Added

### External CDN Libraries
- Swiper 8.x - For slider functionality
- TweenMax 2.1.3 - For animations
- ScrollMagic 2.0.8 - For scroll-triggered animations
- Vivus 0.4.6 - For SVG animations

### Local Libraries (already present)
- bodyScrollLock - For preventing body scroll
- Various minified animation libraries

## Error Handling

All scripts now include:
- Dependency availability checks
- DOM element existence validation
- Graceful fallbacks when elements are missing
- Console warnings for debugging

## Usage

The scripts will now:
1. Wait for DOM to be ready before initializing
2. Check for required dependencies before running
3. Validate that required DOM elements exist
4. Provide helpful console messages for debugging
5. Gracefully handle missing elements without breaking

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the browser console to check for any remaining errors
3. Verify that sliders, animations, and interactions work properly
4. Test on different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior

## Notes

- Some features may still require specific DOM elements to be present in your HTML
- Console warnings will help identify any missing elements or dependencies
- The scripts are now more robust and won't break the page if elements are missing
